# Chrome extension : local cookies eraser

I needed a way to quickly delete my localhost cookies without having to go to the settings each time, so here it is.

This is mainly a mashup of a the chrome cookie api sample [here](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html) and [this stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6694173/manage-cookies-from-google-chrome-extension).

## Tests

This is not really tested: I tried it on my laptop, and it worked, so it's good enough for me.

## What's next

If I don't find the time or the need, nothing. Otherwise, support for safari/firefox.
Maybe a setting to supply a pattern to delete only certain localhost cookies.

This is what, 10 lines of codes? You need a licence for that?
